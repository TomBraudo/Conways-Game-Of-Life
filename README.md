# Conway's Game of Life

A web-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life, built with modular JavaScript and a modern UI. This project was developed as part of an AI-assisted software engineering exercise.

## Features
- **Resizable Grid:** 40x40 by default, with options from 10x10 to 60x60.
- **Simulation Controls:** Start, stop, clear, and randomize the grid.
- **Cell Interaction:** Toggle individual cells (alive/dead) when simulation is stopped.
- **Speed Control:** Adjustable simulation speed with live display.
- **Pattern Library:** Choose from a library of classic patterns (e.g., Glider, Block, Blinker, Pulsar, etc.).
- **Save/Restore:** Save and restore board states using your browser's local storage.

## How to Run
1. **Download the repository:**
   - Click the green `Code` button on GitHub and select `Download ZIP`.
   - Extract the ZIP file to your computer.
2. **Open the app:**
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser (double-click or right-click and choose "Open with").
   - No installation or server required—everything runs locally in your browser.

## Requirements
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.)
- No additional dependencies or setup needed.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` — Main HTML file
- `styles.css` — App styling
- `js/` — JavaScript source files:
  - `game.js` (Game logic)
  - `grid.js` (Grid rendering)
  - `controls.js` (Simulation controls)
  - `app.js` (App initialization)
